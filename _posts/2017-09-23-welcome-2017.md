Welcome 2017

Whether you’re new to Hacksoc and the University of Nottingham, or you’ve been with us for a while now, welcome back! We have exciting plans for this academic year, including HackNotts, as well as a host of different tech talks and coding sessions.
To kick things off, we’re having an introductory taster session on Saturday the 30th, at 5:30pm in the Hub. Free food is a given, and you’ll get to find out more about what we have in store for this year, and what we do generally if you don’t know already (an especially good reason to come along if you’re a fresher!)
Hope to see you there!
